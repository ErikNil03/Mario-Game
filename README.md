# Mario-Game

Made as a High School Project in 2020 in Processing.

It is a game made for fun. 
It has a main menu and a normal stage and after a while you can access the boss stage. Then you have to fight Bowser.
If you manage to beat Bowser by throwing fireballs at him, you win! Then it takes you to another menu, which gives you the
options to either back to main menu or play again.

Controls:
Right Arrow - Forward
Left Arrow - Backward
Up Arrow - Jump
Shift - Shoot Fireballs (Only in Boss Stage)
